							# Minishell #
Through the Minishell project, you will get to the core of the Unix system and explore
an important part of this system’s API: process creation and synchronisation. Executing
a command inside a shell implies creating a new process, which execution and final state
will be monitored by its parent’s process. This set of functions will be the key to success
for your Minishell, so be sure to code the cleanest, simplest program possible.
